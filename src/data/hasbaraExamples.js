    statement: "Israel has the most moral army in the world, taking unprecedented steps to avoid civilian casualties.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "This is classic hasbara. The phrase 'most moral army in the world' is a propaganda slogan used to preempt criticism. While framed as fact, it's an unprovable moral claim that serves to deflect accountability.",
    indicators: ["Superlative claim", "Moral framing", "No verifiable metric", "Official talking point"]
  },

    statement: "The UN reports that over 10,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.",

    statement: "Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, which is why so many die in Israeli operations.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "While Hamas operates in densely populated areas (Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on Earth), this framing shifts moral responsibility for civilian deaths from the attacker to the defenders. It suggests that civilian presence justifies bombing them.",
