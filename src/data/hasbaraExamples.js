    statement: "Israel has the most moral army in the world, taking unprecedented steps to avoid civilian casualties.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "Classic hasbara line. 'Most moral army' is a vibes claim, not a measurable fact. It’s there to preempt criticism and launder civilian harm as virtue.",
    indicators: ["Superlative claim", "Moral framing", "No verifiable metric", "Official talking point"]
  },

    id: 2,
    statement: "The UN reports that over 10,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 2023.",
    isHasbara: false,
    explanation: "This is a verifiable statement from the United Nations, reported by international organizations. Facts that are uncomfortable are not propaganda.",
    indicators: ["Attributable source", "Verifiable data", "Widely reported by independent media"]
  },

    id: 3,
    statement: "Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, which is why so many die in Israeli operations.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "Yes, Gaza is dense. But this framing dumps moral responsibility on the people being bombed and pretends civilian presence makes bombing acceptable.",

    statement: "Both Israelis and Palestinians deserve to live in peace and security.",

    statement: "Gaza is an open-air prison where movement, resources, and economy are controlled by Israel.",
    isHasbara: false,
    explanation: "This is a characterization used by human rights organizations, UN officials, and observers to describe the conditions of the 17-year blockade. It's a political statement, though based on documented restrictions.",

    statement: "Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, so there is no occupation. Any problems are Hamas's fault.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "This talking point ignores that Israel maintains control over Gaza's borders, airspace, waters, population registry, and economy. International law and the UN still consider Gaza occupied. This framing absolves Israel of responsibility.",

    statement: "Palestinians celebrated in the streets after 9/11.",

    statement: "If Palestinians would just stop teaching their children to hate, there would be peace.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "This orientalist narrative places sole responsibility on Palestinians while ignoring the occupation, as well as factors like Israeli military education, settler violence, and structural oppression. It suggests the problem is a cultural one rather than a political one.",

    statement: "This conflict is complicated and has been going on for thousands of years.",
    isHasbara: true,
    explanation: "While often said with good intentions, this is a hasbara talking point. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict began in the 20th century with Zionist colonization. Framing it as ancient and incomprehensible obscures clear historical facts and present realities.",
